# arviz-stats
ArviZ statistics and diagnostics functions.

## Installation

It currently can only be installed with pip:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} PyPI
:sync: stable

```bash
pip install "arviz-stats[xarray]"
```
:::
:::{tab-item} GitHub
:sync: dev

```bash
pip install "arviz-stats[xarray] @ git+https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz-stats"
```
:::
::::


Note that it is also possible to install `arviz-stats` without the `[xarray]`.
Doing that will install a minimal package, which only depends on numpy and scipy.
Consequently, the functions that take arrays as inputs will be available,
but many features won't be available.

This is mostly aimed at advanced users or libraries that want to use ArviZ
to compute diagnostics and statistical summaries but don't want to depend on xarray.
