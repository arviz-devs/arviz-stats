In contrast, the xarray interface is designed for end users, which simplifies usage by automating common tasks and handling metadata. In this overview, we will focus on the xarray interface. For a description of the array interface, please refer to the {ref}`array interface <array_interface>` guide."

ArviZ provides several pre-saved models, so we can use one of those to demonstrate the statistical functionality. In this case we will use the `centered_eight` model, which is a classic, but even if you are not familiar with it, you can still follow along and see how the computations works."

By default this function computes a series of statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, and credible intervals (defaults to equally tailed interval `eti`) for each variable in the model. It also computes a series of diagnostics, including the effective sample size (ess), the rhat statistic, and the Monte Carlo standard error (mcse)."

    "## ArviZ and DataTree\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen two functions, they both use the same input `data`, but generate different results. This is a common pattern in ArviZ, we pass an object like `data` and ArviZ performs different computations based on the function we call. This allows us to easily switch between different functions without having to change the underlying data structure. Internally ArviZ selects the necessary subset of the data to perform the computations. Thus, we don't need to worry about the details of how the data is organized or how to extract the relevant information for each function, unless we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `data` is a `DataTree` object; a flexible and efficient structure for storing and manipulating data in ArviZ. While DataTrees are used extensively in ArviZ, they are not specific to it; they are actually a core data structure in the [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) library. We rely on DataTrees because they offer a powerful way to represent multi-dimensional data with labeled axes, making it straightforward to work with the complex datasets, including those generated during a Bayesian workflow, such as posterior samples, prior samples, and sampling statistics. This structure promotes clear organization and simplifies both data access and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep this introduction short and simple we are going to focus our attention on some very general concepts related to DataTrees in the context of ArviZ. Details on how to work with DataTrees, and a description of other data-structures used by ArviZ, can be found in the [Working With DataTree](https://arviz-devs.github.io/EABM/Chapters/DataTree.html) guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a `DataTree` is a hierarchical structure with groups, the number of groups varies but within ArviZ we have a convention for the names of the groups. For instance, the posterior samples are stored in a group called `posterior`, the prior samples are stored in a group called `prior`, and the sampling statistics (stuff related to the inner workings of samplers) are stored in a group called `sample_stats`. This allows for a clear organization of the data, making it easy to access and manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that for the `centered_eight` model we have several groups:"

    "By default the xarray interface will use one or more of the available groups. For instance the `summary` function will use the `posterior` group, while the `metrics` function will use both the `posterior_predictive` and the `observed_data` groups. These two functions combine the `chain` and `draw` dimensions to produce the final computations. That explains, for example, why we get a single mean for each variable when calling summary even when the posterior is represented using 2000 samples, 4 chains x 500 draws. But notice, for instance, that the dimension `school` is not \"reduced\", instead we get a different \"mean\" (and other quantities) for each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these defaults can be changed, as we already saw with the `var_names` argument. Usually ArviZ functions will have a `group` argument. For instance the `metrics` function does not have it, as computations are always done using the `posterior_predictive` and the `observed_data`, but summary has it and allows you to specify many different groups.\n",
