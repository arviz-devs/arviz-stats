    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Modern Bayesian statistics models are usually build and solve using probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) such as PyMC, Stan, NumPyro, etc. These languages allow users to specify models in a high-level language and perform inference using state-of-the-art algorithms like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Variational Inference (VI). As a result we usually get a posterior distribution, in the form of samples. The posterior distribution has a central role in Bayesian statistics, but other distributions like the posterior and prior predictive distribution are also of interest. And other quantities may be relevant too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct visualization, analysis, and interpretation of these computed data is key to properly answer the questions that motivate our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with Bayesian models there are a series of related tasks that need to be addressed besides inference itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diagnoses of the quality of the inference\n",
    "* Model criticism, including evaluations of both model assumptions and model predictions\n",
    "* Comparison of models, including model selection or model averaging\n",
    "* Preparation of the results for a particular audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call these tasks exploratory analysis of Bayesian models (EABM). Successfully performing such tasks are central to the iterative and interactive modelling process (See [Bayesian Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808)). In the words of [Persi Diaconis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118150702.ch1). \n",
    "\n",
    "> “Exploratory data analysis seeks to reveal structure, or simple descriptions in data.\n",
    "We look at numbers or graphs and try to find patterns. We pursue leads suggested by\n",
    "background information, imagination, patterns perceived, and experience with other data\n",
    "analyses”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of ArviZ is to provide a unified interface for performing exploratory analysis of Bayesian models in Python, regardless of the PPL used to perform inference. This allows users to focus on the analysis and interpretation of the results, rather than on the details of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ArviZ modularization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ArviZ functionality can be made available through a common namespace `arviz`, but ArviZ is composed of 3 smaller libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [arviz-base](https://arviz-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) data related functionality, including converters from different PPLs.\n",
    "* [arviz-stats](https://arviz-stats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for statistical summaries, diagnostics, metrics and other estimators.\n",
    "* [arviz-plots](https://arviz-plots.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for visual checks built on top of arviz-stats and arviz-base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some users may only need a subset of the functionality provided by ArviZ, and in that case they can install only the relevant library. However, most users will benefit from installing the full ArviZ package, which includes all three libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instructions on how to install ArviZ, please refer to the [installation guide](https://python.arviz.org/en/stable/getting_started/Installation.html)."

    "\n",
    "So far we have seen two functions, they both use the same input `data`, but generate different results. This is a common pattern in ArviZ, we pass an object like `data` and ArviZ perform different computations based on the function we call. This allows us to easily switch between different functions without having to change the underlying data structure. Internally ArviZ select the necessary subset of the data to perform the computations. Thus, we don't need to worry about the details of how the data is organized or how to extract the relevant information for each plot, unless we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `data` is a `DataTree` object; a flexible and efficient structure for storing and manipulating data in ArviZ. While DataTrees are used extensively in ArviZ, they are not specific to it; they are actually a core data structure in the [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) library. We rely on DataTrees because they offer a powerful way to represent multi-dimensional data with labeled axes, making it straightforward to work with the complex datasets, including those generated during a Bayesian workflow, such as posterior samples, prior samples, and sampling statistics. This structure promotes clear organization and simplifies both data access and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep this introduction short and simple we are going to focus our attention on some very general concepts related to DataTrees in the context of plotting with ArviZ. Details on how to work with DataTrees, and a description of other data-structures used by ArviZ, can be found in the [Working With DataTree](https://arviz-devs.github.io/EABM/Chapters/DataTree.html) guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a `DataTree` is a hierarchical structure with groups, the number of groups vary but within ArviZ we have a convention for the names of the groups. For instance, the posterior samples are stored in a group called `posterior`, the prior samples are stored in a group called `prior`, and the sampling statistics (stuff related to the inner workings of samplers) are stored in a group called `sample_stats`. This allows for a clear organization of the data, making it easy to access and manipulate.\n",

    "By default the xarray interface will use one or more of the available groups. For instance the `summary` function will use the `posterior` group, while the `metrics` function will use both the `posterior_predictive` and the `observed_data` groups. These two functions combine the `chain` and `draw` dimensions to produce the final computations. That explain, for example, why we get a single mean for each variable when calling summary even when the posterior is represented using 2000 samples, 4 chains x 500 draws. But notice, for instance that the dimension `school` is not \"reduced\", instead we get a different \"mean\" (and other quantities) for each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these defaults can be changed, as we already saw with the `var_names` argument. Usually ArviZ functions will have a `group` argument. For instance the `metrics` function does not have it, as computation are always done using the `posterior_predictive` and the `observed_data`, but summary have it and allows you to specify many groups different groups\n",
